	<p>The beluga, or white whale, is one of the smallest species of whale. Their distinctive color and prominent foreheads make them easily identifiable.</p>
	<p>Unlike most other whales, the beluga has a very flexible neck that enables it to nod and turn its head in all directions.</p>
	<p>Belugas generally live together in small groups known as pods. They are social animals and vocal communicators using a diversified language of clicks, whistles, and clangs. Belugas can also copy a variety of other sounds.</p>
	<p>These whales are common in the Arctic Ocean's coastal waters, though they are found in subarctic waters as well. Arctic belugas migrate southward in large herds when the sea freezes over.</p>
	<p>Belugas feed on fish, crustaceans, and worms.</p>
	<p>The whale is related to the tusked "unicorn" whale known as the narwhal.</p>

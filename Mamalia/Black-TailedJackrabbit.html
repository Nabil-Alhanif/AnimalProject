	<p>These speedy animals are capable of reaching 40 miles an hour​.</p>
	<p>Black-tailed jackrabbits are not actually rabbits, but are hares. Hares are born with fur and are larger than rabbits. They usually have taller hind legs and longer ears.</p>
	<p>These speedy animals are capable of reaching 40 miles (64 kilometers)​ an hour​. They have powerful hind legs that can propel them on leaps of more than ​10​ feet​ (3 meters)​​. They use these leaps and a zigzag running style to evade their many predators, including coyotes.</p>
	<p>Jackrabbits produce a lot of young called leverets or bunnies. Females give birth to several litters a year, each with one to six young. The young mature quickly and require little care from their mothers.</p>
	<p>Other species of jackrabbits live in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. While the endangered status of most species is least concern, the Tehuantepec jackrabbit is considered near threatened.</p>

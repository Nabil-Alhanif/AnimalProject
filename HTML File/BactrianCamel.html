	<h1>Bactrian Camel</h1>
</div>
<div>
	<p>Bactrian camels have two humps on their backs where they store fat. Their nostrils close to block sand, and their bushy eyebrows and two rows of long eyelashes protect their eyes from blowing sand and ice.</p>
	<p>Arabian camels, called dromedaries, have only one hump, but both Arabian and Bactrian camels use their stored fat as energy and water when they are far away from food and a freshwater source.</p>
	<p>Camels move both legs on one side of the body forward at the same time, like giraffes and race horses. This is called pacing. Baby camels are born with their eyes open and can run when they are only a few hours old.</p>
	<p>The only truly wild camels that still exist are Bactrian camels. These herds survive in the Gobi desert of Mongolia and China, but number less than 400. They are critically endangered in the wild.</p>

	<p>Beavers are the largest rodents (gnawing animals) in North America.</p>
	<p>Beavers are the second largest rodents in the world, behind the South American capybara.</p>
	<p>Beavers are powerful swimmers that can swim underwater for up to 15 minutes. As the beaver dips underwater, the nose and ears shut to keep water out. Transparent inner eyelids close over each eye to help the beaver see.</p>
